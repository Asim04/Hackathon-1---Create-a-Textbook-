## Response snapshot

**Phase 6 Complete: Vision-Guided Action and Autonomous Humanoid Capstone** ✅

Executed all 14 tasks (T050-T063) for Chapter 4:

**T050-T059 [US4] - Content Creation**:
- Created capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md with proper frontmatter
- Wrote 5 learning objectives using Bloom's taxonomy verbs
- Completed 7 sections: Introduction (200w), Object Detection and Scene Understanding (400w), 6D Pose Estimation (400w), Vision-Guided Action (450w), Closed-Loop Control and Visual Servoing (400w), Capstone Autonomous Humanoid Workflow (600w), Simulation-First Approach (400w)
- Added summary and module wrap-up (250w)

**T060-T061 [US4] - Citations & References**:
- Added inline APA citations throughout (VLA-01, VLA-02, SR-01, LLM-01, VIS-01, VIS-02, INT-01, INT-02, INT-03, etc.)
- Created comprehensive references section with sources from research.md

**T062-T063 [US4] - Validation**:
- Word count: ~3,100 words (comprehensive coverage of all required topics)
- Reading level: Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 appropriate for undergraduate students

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `docs/module-4-vla/capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md`: Complete Chapter 4 (3,100+ words, 9 sections)
- `specs/005-module-4-vla/tasks.md`: Phase 6 tasks marked [x] complete

**Constitutional Compliance**:
- ✅ Accuracy: All claims supported by APA citations (VLA-01/02/03/04, VIS-01/02/03/04, INT-01/02/03, SR-01, LLM-01)
- ✅ Clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12 reading level achieved
- ✅ Reproducibility: Stable URLs and DOIs in references section
- ✅ Rigor: Technical accuracy validated through research sources
- ✅ Originality: 100% original content created
- ✅ Modularity: Self-contained chapter with objectives and takeaways

**Module Complete**: All 4 VLA chapters (Introduction, Voice-to-Action, Language-to-Plan, Vision-Guided Action) now complete

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Chapter 4 complete. Students can now understand vision-guided action, 6D pose estimation, closed-loop control, visual servoing, capstone workflow, and simulation-first development.
- 🧪 Tests: No executable tests (content validation). All 14 writing tasks passed validation.
- 📁 Files: Created capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md (3,100+ words), updated tasks.md (Phase 6 complete).
- 🔁 Next prompts: Complete Module 4 with overview and integration phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Module 4 successfully completed with comprehensive VLA pipeline coverage from voice input to autonomous humanoid execution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All validation tasks passed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): T050-T063 all PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard content writing workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Complete Module 4 integration and validation phases
