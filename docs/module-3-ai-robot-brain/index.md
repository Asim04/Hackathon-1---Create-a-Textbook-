# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Module Overview

[Content to be added: Module introduction, learning objectives, and chapter overview]

## Prerequisites

**Required Knowledge from Previous Modules**:
- **Module 1 (ROS 2 Fundamentals)**: Understanding of ROS 2 topics, nodes, packages, URDF robot descriptions
- **Module 2 (Digital Twin)**: Gazebo physics simulation concepts, sensor types (LiDAR, depth camera, IMU)

**General Prerequisites**:
- Basic programming literacy (can read pseudocode)
- Understanding of coordinate systems and 3D transformations
- No AI/ML background required (concepts explained from scratch)

## Module Chapters

1. [Introduction to AI-Driven Robotics](./intro) - Classical vs AI-driven approaches, Physical AI concepts, NVIDIA Isaac role
2. [Isaac Sim Fundamentals](./isaac-sim) - Photorealistic simulation, USD format, sensor simulation, synthetic data generation
3. [Isaac ROS for Perception](./isaac-ros-perception) - Visual SLAM, stereo vs RGB-D depth sensing, Jetson hardware acceleration
4. [Navigation and Sim-to-Real Transfer](./navigation-and-sim2real) - Nav2 path planning, localization, sim-to-real deployment

## Learning Path

**Estimated Reading Time**: 60-90 minutes total

This module builds on your knowledge from Modules 1-2 to introduce AI-driven robotics concepts using the NVIDIA Isaac platform. You'll learn how Isaac Sim enables photorealistic simulation for training perception models, how Isaac ROS provides hardware-accelerated perception pipelines, and how to deploy AI models from simulation to physical robots.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the difference between classical robotics and AI-driven robotics approaches
- Explain the role of NVIDIA Isaac in Physical AI systems for humanoid robots
- Describe how Isaac Sim uses photorealistic simulation and USD format for AI training
- Understand Visual SLAM, depth sensing techniques, and hardware acceleration on Jetson devices
- Outline the sim-to-real transfer workflow from Isaac Sim to physical robot deployment

## Next Steps

Begin with [Chapter 1: Introduction to AI-Driven Robotics](./intro) to understand the fundamental concepts behind AI-powered robotics.
